DATS6312 NLP Final Project

By Deyu KONG & Sertan Akinci

Toxic comments on social media is being more and more prevalent over the years and are severely undermining the quality of discussion. Researchers have been trying to find better ways to detect and classify toxic comments, to safeguard and facilitate constructive communication.

This project we use the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/overview. It is a multilabel classification problem with more than 300,000 observations of annotated data.

We aim to build a transformer based multilabel classification model and perform inference on heldout test as well as newly written entries.
